    <p class="article">The 2024 Formula 1 season was dominated by Max Verstappen, who secured his fourth consecutive Drivers' Championship with an impressive 9 wins and numerous podium finishes. Verstappen’s consistency and speed throughout the season, including his dominant performances in races like Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, and Japan, were key to his success. His victory tally helped Red Bull Racing continue their strong performance, but it was McLaren’s resurgence that added excitement to the season.</p>
    <p class="article">The biggest story of the year in the Constructors' Championship was McLaren's remarkable performance. They clinched their first Constructors' Championship since 1998, powered by strong finishes from Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri. Piastri especially made a splash, earning his first career win at the Hungarian Grand Prix, marking a significant breakthrough for both him and the team.</p>
    <p class="article">Notable moments also included Lewis Hamilton ending a 945-day winless streak with a long-awaited victory at the British Grand Prix. This victory was a turning point in his career, proving he still had the speed and talent to compete at the highest level. Charles Leclerc also had a strong season, claiming a much-needed win at the Monaco Grand Prix, which was his first there since 2017. Meanwhile, Lando Norris capped off the season with a victory at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, further solidifying McLaren's position as a top team.</p>
    <p class="article">Driver movements and changes in the technical landscape also made headlines in 2024. Carlos Sainz Jr., after some strong performances for Ferrari, announced his move to Williams for the 2025 season, following the appointment of Lewis Hamilton as Ferrari's new lead driver. Meanwhile, Red Bull’s legendary Adrian Newey, the mastermind behind many of their championship-winning cars, announced his departure, signaling potential changes for the team’s technical future.</p>

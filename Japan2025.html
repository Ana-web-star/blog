Verstappen maintained his lead after a tense moment exiting the pits, where he was side-by-side with Norris, who briefly went off-track. Despite Norris setting the fastest lap of his race on lap 45, he was unable to catch Verstappen, finishing just 1.423 seconds behind. Piastri, Norris's teammate, completed the podium in third, 2.129 seconds behind his McLaren colleague.

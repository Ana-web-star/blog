    <p class="article">The 2025 Australian Grand Prix, held on March 16 at Melbourne's Albert Park Circuit, kicked off the Formula 1 season with a thrilling race full of drama and surprises. Lando Norris of McLaren secured the victory after starting from pole position. He led most of the race but faced challenges from Max Verstappen, who briefly took the lead. Despite a brief loss of control due to changing weather conditions, Norris regained the top spot after making a timely pit stop. Verstappen, driving for Red Bull Racing, finished in second place, while Mercedes' George Russell rounded out the podium in third. Andrea Kimi Antonelli, also in a Mercedes, made an impressive recovery, moving from 16th to 4th, although he initially received a five-second penalty for an unsafe release in the pit, which was later overturned.</p>
    <p class="article">The race was held under light rain, causing slippery conditions on the track and leading to several retirements. Notable retirements included rookie drivers Isack Hadjar and Gabriel Bortoleto, who both suffered accidents. Additionally, high-profile drivers such as Fernando Alonso, Carlos Sainz Jr., and Jack Doohan also retired from the race. The race was briefly delayed after Hadjar's crash on the formation lap, adding to the chaotic start of the event.</p>
    <p class="article">After the race, the championship standings saw a shift, with Norris leading the Drivers' Championship with 25 points, followed by Verstappen with 18 points and Russell with 15 points. In the Constructors' Championship, McLaren and Mercedes were tied at the top with 27 points each, while Red Bull Racing sat in third with 18 points. Norris's victory in Australia marked a significant change in the early season dynamics, as it broke Verstappenâ€™s long-standing dominance in the sport.

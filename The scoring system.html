    <p class="article">In Formula 1, points are awarded to the top ten finishers in each Grand Prix. The winner of the race receives 25 points, second place gets 18, and third place earns 15. From there, points continue to decrease: fourth place gets 12, fifth earns 10, and sixth receives 8. Seventh place gets 6 points, eighth gets 4, ninth takes 2 points, and finally, tenth place earns 1 point.</p>
    <p class="article">On selected weekends, Formula 1 also holds a shorter Sprint race, which offers extra points to the top eight finishers. The winner of the Sprint gets 8 points, with each following position earning one less, down to 1 point for eighth place.</p>
    <p class="article">All points earned go toward both the Drivers' Championship (individual drivers) and the Constructors' Championship (team totals from both drivers). These point totals determine who becomes World Champion at the end of the season.</p>

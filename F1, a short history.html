    <p class="article">Formula 1, or F1, is the premier class of international single-seater auto racing, governed by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA). It originated in 1950, when the first official World Championship was held at Silverstone, UK. The championship brought together the top Grand Prix races already taking place in Europe.</p>
    <p class="article">In the 1950s and 60s, legends like Juan Manuel Fangio, who won five titles, and manufacturers like Ferrari and Mercedes-Benz helped establish F1’s prestige. The sport grew more technical through the 1970s and 80s, with innovations in aerodynamics, turbocharged engines, and ground effect design. This era also saw intense rivalries, such as that between Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost.</p>
    <p class="article">The 1990s and early 2000s were dominated by Michael Schumacher, who won seven championships—five with Ferrari—setting new records. F1 became increasingly global, adding races in Asia and the Middle East.</p>
    <p class="article">In recent years, the focus has shifted toward hybrid technology, sustainability, and entertainment. Lewis Hamilton equaled Schumacher’s record with seven titles, and Red Bull Racing, led by Max Verstappen, has become the team to beat in the 2020s.</p>

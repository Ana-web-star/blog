    <p class="article">Tires are a crucial part of race strategy and performance. All teams use tires supplied by Pirelli, the official and exclusive tire manufacturer. Each race weekend, teams are provided with several types of tires that fall into two main categories: dry-weather tires (called "slicks") and wet-weather tires.</p>
    <p class="article">Dry-weather tires come in five compounds, ranging from C1 (the hardest) to C5 (the softest). For each race, Pirelli selects three of these and designates them as Hard (white), Medium (yellow), and Soft (red). Hard tires are the most durable but offer the least grip, while Soft tires provide the most grip but wear out quickly. Medium tires offer a balance between performance and durability. During a dry race, drivers must use at least two different types of dry tires, which makes at least one pit stop mandatoryâ€”unless rain changes the conditions.</p>
    <p class="article">When it rains, teams switch to wet-weather tires, which come in two types: Intermediate (with a green stripe) and Full Wet (with a blue stripe). Intermediate tires are used in light rain or on drying tracks, while Full Wets are for heavy rain and standing water. These are the only tires with tread patterns designed to clear water and prevent aquaplaning.</p>
    <p class="article">Tire strategy is a major element of racing. Teams have to decide when to pit and which tires to use based on track conditions, weather, and wear rates. Softer tires are faster but degrade more quickly, requiring more pit stops, while harder tires are slower but can last much longer. Getting this balance right can mean the difference between winning and losing a race.</p>
